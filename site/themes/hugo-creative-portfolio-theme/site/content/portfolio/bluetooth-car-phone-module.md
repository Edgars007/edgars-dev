My car had an integrated phone module that works together with radio, speakers and has its own speaker and microphone. Problem was that it it is a bit outdated, because only way how to use it to put a SIM card in it. It is not very convenient. So I wanted to leave everything as original as possible just to "replace" sim card feature with bluetooth so that it connects to my phone and everything else is the same.
