My car\'s dip stick got broken. The plastic part of it. Last time when I was looking for one to buy at junkyard it took me a lot of time for even finding one for sale.

Long story short - it is rare. So this time I decided to spend less time and money and fix the broken one. 

Unfortunately I don\'t have any pictures of this thing broken. The plastic part was broken in two pieces, along the groove where rubber ring seal goes.

I didn't had nobody around me to help hold it in place, so used the help of zipties.

I took small screws and nip off the heads.

Joined parts back together by melting couple of those screws inside plastic with soldering iron.

Cleaned up the groove for rubber ring using knife and soldering iron.

Placed back the rubber ring and well done, better than new! At least hold itself together better than before for sure. Took me around twenty minutes.
